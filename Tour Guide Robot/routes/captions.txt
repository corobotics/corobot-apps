HonorsLab&_
ICL1&The instructional computing labs exist so that students may program under the guidance of their professors and engage in hands-on work. When not in use by classes, students may enter most labs and work on classwork or independent projects.
ICL2&At RIT, every computer scientist learns the value of working with others. Complex problems become simpler ones when working with peers, professors, and upperclassmen. A hard-working student has the opportunity as early as their second year to apply for a paid position helping others develop their coding skills!
ICL3&Students are encouraged to come here, to the Tutoring Center, if they need any help with their Computer Science homework, or to prepare for exams. To assist, paid tutors are kept on-hand so that no question goes unanswered. In addition to the tutoring center, introductory CS courses hold weekly recitations, twice-weekly Supplemental Instruction sessions, and exam review sessions before each midterm and the final. There is also an online forum for each course. You can ask questions from the comfort of your own dorm if you so choose!
ICL5&While the CS department provides computers in the labs, students are encouraged to bring their own laptops. Either way, they are taught how to code by way of easy-to-use programs called Integrated Development Environments, or IDEs. Students at RIT are taught to use industry-standard tools, such as Git and Putty.
ICL6&There are many different labs available at RIT, and not just in the computer science buildings. With just a student account, you can access the computers in Golisano, Nathaniel Rochester Hall, as well as the Wallace Library. Printing services are also available depending on which school a student is a member of: CS, Engineering, Science, et cetera. A plethora of university resources are always in arm's reach!
PatternLab&The Document and Pattern Recognition Lab explores ways to improve the algorithms and tools used for automatic recognition and retrieval of information in documents, images, audio and video, as its name suggests. Here, specialized software and applications are developed that improve the efficiency of other tasks.
DistribLab&_
GraphicsLab&Members of the CS Graphics and Applied Perception Lab perform funded research in the areas of computer graphics, eye tracking, and virtual reality. In addition, the lab provides a sandbox for interdisciplinary and cross-college collaboration with faculty and students from departments ranging from 3D Design and Photography, to Color Science and Imaging Science, to Computer Engineering.
