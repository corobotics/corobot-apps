To run this on a corobot, download all the source and resources from here. In addition, you will need the Java API from [corobot-clients](http://github.com/corobotics/corobot-clients/) and the Java 8 JDK.

Note that this code does use the corobot API, but must be run locally so that the GUI appears on the corobot's screen.
